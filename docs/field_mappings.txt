Here are the field mappings so that when they are displayed in a results table or CSV, human-friendly names are used:
memberid = Member id
firstname = First Name
lastname = Last Name
gender = Gender
signuplocation = Sign Up Location or Sign Up Store or Sign Up Branch
total_sales = Total Sales
transactioncount = Transaction Count
sales / transaction count = Average Basket Size
yearmonth = Month-Year

In general, display human-friendly column names.  Do not use the mysql generated column names.
