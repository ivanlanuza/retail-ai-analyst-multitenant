QUESTION:
Give me top 150 members based on average monthly visits.

CORRECT QUERY:
SELECT m.memberid AS `Member id`, m.firstname AS `First Name`, m.lastname AS `Last Name`, 
       SUM(mt.transactioncount) AS `Transaction Count`, 
       SUM(mt.transactioncount)/COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(yearmonth, '%Y-%m')) AS `Average Monthly Visits`
FROM members m
JOIN metrics mt ON m.memberid = mt.memberid
GROUP BY m.memberid
ORDER BY `Average Monthly Visits` DESC
LIMIT 150;
