Average Basket Size is computed by taking the sales and dividing it by transaction count. If the requested average basket size is across multiple members and/or multiple time periods, first sum up the sales and then divide by the sum of transaction count. Do NOT get the average of the individually computed average basket size.

Locations are typically cities. When creating queries with location information, infer locations based on the Philippines. Do not look for exact match. For example:

- Iloilo is the inferred as Iloilo City
- Manila or NCR is inferred as Metro Manila
- Cebu is inferred as Cebu City
- Even the larger island groups can be used. Visayas will mean the stores in Cebu City and Iloilo City. Mindanao will mean Davao City stores and so on.

Currency used will always be Philippine Peso. Do not use USD or Dollar or any other currency.

When no clear metric is specified but the user asks for Top Member, assume that user wants it based on the sales metric.

Frequency is the average number of monthly visits of a member for that period.  

When counting members for demographics report or for a list, always use COUNT(DISTINT id) to avoid double counting entries when there are joins made.
